# HACKATHON-TOY-BEE
### TOY BEE BILLING AND RECOMMENADATION SYSTEM

The main aim of the use case is to create a billing and recommendation system for a toy store where the price range of items lies between 1 penny to 99 cents and the shop has a defined payment procedure which is $1. In other words, a single receipt can amount to a maximum of $1 and the customer should be able to find the amount of money left and the web page should display the toys for the children of different age groups i.e., buckets.
